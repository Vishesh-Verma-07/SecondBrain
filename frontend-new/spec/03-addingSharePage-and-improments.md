Further improve the existing frontend while keeping the current architecture, design language, and folder structure intact. Maintain the clean, minimal, professional SaaS aesthetic.

Implement the following enhancements:

### 1. Public Share Brain Page
Create a proper public sharing experience.

When a shared URL such as:

http://localhost:3001/brain/:shareId

is opened, render a dedicated public page instead of a blank or basic view.

The page should include:
- A clean public layout (without the authenticated dashboard sidebar).
- The Brain Dock branding.
- Brain title.
- Description (if available).
- Owner information (if available from the backend).
- Last updated date.
- Collections being shared.
- All shared content displayed in a clean responsive Bento Grid.
- Tags for each content item.
- Ability to open an individual shared content item.
- Proper empty state if nothing is shared.
- Proper 404 page if the share link is invalid.
- Loading skeleton while data is being fetched.

The page should look polished and feel like a professional shared workspace rather than a raw data page.

### 2. Improve Share Brain Dialog/Page

The current share flow should be upgraded.

Instead of only generating a link, allow the user to control **what is being shared**.

Before generating or updating the share link, provide options such as:

- Share Entire Brain
- Share Selected Collections
- Share Individual Notes/Content (if supported by backend)

The UI should make it obvious what is included in the shared link.

Display:
- Generated public URL
- Copy Link button
- Open Link button
- Share Status (Public/Private)

Show toast notifications after successful actions.

### 3. Replace Browser Alerts

Remove every usage of:

- window.alert()
- window.confirm()

Replace them with professional custom dialogs using shadcn/ui components.

For delete actions:

Display a confirmation dialog similar to:

Title:
Delete Content?

Description:
This action cannot be undone. The selected item will be permanently deleted.

Buttons:
- Cancel
- Delete (destructive)

Show a success toast after deletion.

### 4. Improve Tag Filtering UX

The current tag filter becomes cluttered when there are many tags.

Redesign it.

Requirements:

- Show tags inside a horizontally scrollable container.
- Hide the scrollbar if possible while maintaining accessibility.
- Allow horizontal scrolling with mouse wheel, touch, or trackpad.
- Include a search input above the tags.
- Searching should instantly filter available tags.
- Selecting a tag should filter the displayed content.
- Allow selecting multiple tags.
- Selected tags should remain highlighted.
- Include a "Clear Filters" action.

The design should scale well even with 100+ tags.

---

### 5. Loading Experience

Whenever the user performs a search or applies filters:

Display proper loading feedback.

Examples:
- Skeleton cards
- Spinner near the search box
- Loading state while AI search is running
- Disable duplicate search requests while loading

Do not leave the interface feeling unresponsive.

---

### 6. Maintain Existing Design Principles

Do not redesign the entire application.

Continue using:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- shadcn/ui
- Responsive layouts
- Bento Grid for cards
- Professional spacing
- Smooth subtle animations
- Reusable components
- Clean production-ready code

Ensure all new features integrate seamlessly with the existing Brain Dock UI and preserve a polished, modern user experience.
